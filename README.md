Traveling has become risky despite being a vital necessity for human existence. The frequency of traffic accidents is rising over time. According to a recent Times India study, there have been 2 lakhs of documented occurrences of fatal road accidents. Additionally, the recorded mortality instances, almost two-thirds were the result of drunk driving and delayed medical recovery. In this proposed project, NodeMCU is used to transmit messages when the vehicle is met with an accident normally. Additionally, when the driver is boozed the alcoholic sensor will detect it, if the alcohol is detected then immediately it will be notified, and also the speed of the engine will be reduced. In case the vehicle met with an accident after the alcohol is sensed, immediately the vehicle engine will be get stopped and to be get notified.
