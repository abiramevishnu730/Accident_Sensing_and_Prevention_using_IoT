HARDWARE USED 

1.Ignition Switch (ON/OFF)
2.Vibration sensor
3.MQ3 Alcohol sensor
4.Buzzer
5.Transformer
6.Power Supply Unit
7.Motor
8.Arduino Board
9.LCD display
10.Engine control module 

SOFTWARE USED

1. Blynk IoT 

App Link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cloud.blynk

PROCEDURE

Step 1: Start the process
Step 2: Connect the kit to the plug and ON the switch
Step 3: In Mobile, install the Blynk App in the play store in which the App link is given above
Step 4: Change the username to IOT and the password to s1234567 in the Mobile
Step 5: ON Mobile hotspot and mobile network for connecting the kit to Mobile App
Step 6: Once connected, press the ignition switch and start the ignition
Step 7: Now the vehicle is moving normally and once we trigger the vibration sensor, it takes that the vehicle is met with an accident and the beep sound will be produced
Step 8: The 30sec time will be given after the accident occurs, if the driver gets recovered within 30sec then the driver can abort the ignition else after 30sec the buzzer sound will never stop and in App, it notified as Accident detected
Step 9: Next, with the help of the MQ3 alcoholic sensor, if the driver is intoxicated the alcohol is gets detected, and with the help of the Engine Control Module (ECM) the speed of the vehicle will get decreased and in App, it notified as Accident detected
Step 10: End the process
